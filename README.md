# Network Administration and Log Analysis
**Objective**: Performed log analysis to understand network events, using tools like grep and gawk for parsing logs.

## Tools Used
- **grep** and **gawk**: Command-line tools for filtering and analyzing logs.
- **cut**: Extracted specific data fields for targeted analysis.

## Key Concepts
- **Log Analysis**: Techniques to parse logs for security-relevant information.
- **Pattern Matching**: Using regular expressions to locate patterns in log files.

## Lab Overview
1. **Log Filtering**: Used `grep` and `gawk` to isolate specific events and data patterns.
2. **Data Extraction**: Employed `cut` to refine data for deeper analysis.

## Learnings
- Gained proficiency in log analysis for security monitoring.
- Enhanced skills in data parsing and anomaly detection within log files.
